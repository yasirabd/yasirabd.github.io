We enhanced Robosemar V2's conversational capabilities by integrating a Dialogflow-based AI on a Jetson Nano. This new version offers improved noise reduction and faster response times, providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience. We also added the ChatGPT engine into the feature that enables Robosemar V2 to talk about more broad topics.
