The division of tasks:
- SANDEC: Created a mobile application that is able to track locations that have been sprayed by sending GPS data into the cloud.
- DSI JATENG: Preprocess data that has been achieved then create a visualization to monitor the progress of the hand sprayer program.

I preprocessed the data that was achieved from Dinas Kesehatan Kota Semarang (DKK Semarang) and then sent the data to Lingga as resources for creating visualization.
