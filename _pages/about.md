I'm a data scientist with 5+ years of experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Rotating Machinery. I currently work at PT Sanditheta Solusi Digital and Rotopower (PT UNDIP Maju).

I co-founded PT Sanditheta Solusi Digital with Prasasto Adi to provide NLP solutions. My primary role involved developing NLP models for various tasks. I have experience in preprocessing text data, creating and optimizing NLP models, and solving problems like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, classification, text similarity detection, speech recognition, and named entity recognition. I've worked with popular techniques like bag-of-words, word embeddings, using pre-trained models like BERT and GPT, and familiar with Large Language Models (LLM). Recently, we built a conversational AI model for Robosemar, a robot designed to interact with humans and provide information about Semarang.

At Rotopower, I worked alongside [Dr. Eng. Achmad Widodo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4SucAC4AAAAJ&hl=id) and [Toni Prahasto, PhD](https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=Y1ndWpMAAAAJ&hl=en) to address rotating machinery challenges. We successfully resolved several problems for PT PLN Indonesia Power and PLN Puslitbang by developing machine learning models for predictive, prescriptive, and prognostic maintenance, as well as classification and anomaly detection.

The important facts about Yasir Abdur Rohman are that he is also a teacher (teaching informatics) at MA Nurus Sunnah, Head of Human Resource Department (HRD) at Yayasan Islam Nurus Sunnah, and runs Safi Recycle, a company that focuses on creating a better environment.
